    <p>Interviewer: Okay, lots to talk about. Thank you. Thank you for those remarks. Let me begin by offering some of my reflections on the soft landing scenario and get your reactions to those. I agree with you something has to give. I agree with you that we&#x27;re seeing a softening in aggregate demand that seems clear both in terms of business investment and in terms of consumer spending and in terms of the labor market. So if that were to continue, then we could tip into recession, or we could have a soft landing, or we could re-accelerate, and those seem like three mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive possibilities. There seems to be a lot of hope around the soft landing, and kind of conceptualize the soft landing in terms of the labor market. The scenario would be that we go from a, you know, 200,000 job per month economy or a 150,000 job per month economy, kind of wherever you think we are right now, down to a, you know, 40,000 job per month economy, 50,000 job per month economy, something above zero but below the pace needed to keep up with population growth, and then we stay there for four months, five months, six months, something like that, a length of time sufficient to bring inflation back down to target, and then we reaccelerate and we go back to a 150-per-month, 200-per-month economy. That scenario seems to have captivated the imaginations of economists and journalists, it seems to me to be a little too neat and tidy. If you look at post World War II economic history, you don&#x27;t see that happening. What you see is that when the unemployment rate goes up a little, it tends to go up a lot. When you look at employment growth, when year-over-year payroll growth dips below 1.5%, it goes on to go negative. On the other hand, we are in, I think, the most unusual period of economic history since the demobilization from World War II. A lot of things that weren&#x27;t supposed to happen have happened and a lot of the laws of economics seem to have been suspended, maybe this time will be different and we&#x27;ll get the soft landing. So my question to you, am I unduly pessimistic about this or do you think that a soft landing could happen, but my general assumption is that it could… assessment of its likelihood seems reasonable.</p>
    <p>Waller: Well, I&#x27;m an optimist. So back in May &#x27;22, I gave a speech outlining what I thought a soft landing would be and how we could actually achieve it, and it was large the fact that we had so many vacancies to workers that I thought our efforts in raising the policy rate could put downward pressure on labor demand, getting rid of workers, which there seemed to be a big shortage of, but just reducing the number of vacancies. Now, inevitably there&#x27;s going to be some increase in unemployment, but through some analysis I did with Andy Fragera at the Board of Governors, we said that, look, in unemployment, if there aren&#x27;t massive layoffs, if you just keep the job, the involuntary job separation rate stable, you can get vacancies down, get labor demand down, and unemployment would only go up to maybe 3, 4.3 or 4.4 percent. There was a lot of controversy around that argument, but so far it seems to have played out fairly closely. Unemployment is 3.9. We still haven&#x27;t quite got everything down to where it was in 2019, and so I think that&#x27;s that is where people are starting to say. Yeah, maybe this is going to look like that. If you go back in US history when you think about a recession, it&#x27;s always caused by some major shock, that could happen again. There could be another major shock and this whole soft landing disappears. But shocks are shocks. We can&#x27;t really forecast it, and when I think about the last 18 months, we saw a Russian invasion of Ukraine. We saw the Silicon Valley shock, banking stresses, the recent events in the Middle East. These things have all been what, normally, we&#x27;d think, be a big shock that could tip the economy into recession. But so far, they haven&#x27;t done it. So that&#x27;s why I think just looking at past recessions isn&#x27;t going to be necessarily a good guide in this case. And so that&#x27;s why in unemployment when it goes up it goes up fast It doesn&#x27;t kind of just gradually go up and then flatten out. But as long as we don&#x27;t get any big shocks, I am, you know reasonably confident that we can pull off this soft landing, and you know unemployment probably go up a little bit more, but if we can get inflation to come down, GDP growth to soften but not go negative into a full recession, there&#x27;s no reason we can&#x27;t pull it off. But there&#x27;s always some shock sitting in the background that may happen and blow the whole thing up.</p>
    <p>Interviewer: Let&#x27;s stick with that for a minute. When the soft-landing arguments began to be made, I was more optimistic as well, for exactly the reason that you mentioned, which is that labor market tightness looked to me to be driven more by excessive labor demand than by excessive employment. Labor demand is normalizing. The job worker gap is shrinking, and we still have inflation that is well above the Fed&#x27;s target and there&#x27;s still the risk of inflation kind of getting stuck well above the Fed&#x27;s target and that has that that normalization of labor demand without an accompanying clear path back down to 2% for price inflation has increased my level of pessimism regarding soft landing possibility. With regard to the shocks, how concerned are you about commercial real estate? How concerned are you about private sector data that show an increase in credit card delinquencies? How concerned are you about the data from, or the data that can earnings calls, the talk about concern for weak demand, a weak holiday season. How concerned are you about businesses not gearing up for the holidays with October hiring? How concerned are you about corporate earnings? And yes, we&#x27;ve seen a loosening of financial conditions due to appreciation of stock prices, but that&#x27;s seven stocks out of the 500 and the S&amp;P 500. Does that kind of constellation make you concerned both about a specific shock, maybe it&#x27;s commercial real estate, maybe it&#x27;s credit card delinquencies, and make you concerned that the economy is actually kind of folding faster than the headline statistics suggest?</p>
    <p>Waller: Yeah. So, I mean, on the labor market side, one thing that has also happened is we&#x27;ve seen a very strong comeback in the labor force participation, mainly among prime-age workers from 25 to 54. Women in particular returned to the labor force. force has been astounding. We&#x27;ve seen immigration levels coming back to what they were pre-pandemic in terms of trend. So we&#x27;ve also gotten a lot of help on the supply side of the labor market to help with this reducing demand but not having unemployment go up dramatically. On commercial real estate, everybody knows there&#x27;s going to be repricing in commercial real estate. Repricing occurs, somebody wins, somebody loses. But we all know when that refinancing and repricing is going to happen. It&#x27;s not a shock. It&#x27;s well anticipated. Everybody sees it coming. So that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m not as concerned about somehow we&#x27;re going to wake up one morning and go, &quot;Oh my God, commercial real estate repriced.&quot; We all know it&#x27;s going to do that. That&#x27;s not a shock. So it&#x27;s going to happen over a couple of years. It&#x27;s not going to happen one morning. Every commercial real estate prop in the US has to be refinanced and repriced. So that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m not as concerned about commercial real estate being a shock that throws it into a recession. Is it going to be painful? Yeah, some people are going to lose money when these things have to be refinanced and repriced. But that&#x27;s just the way markets work. So I&#x27;m not too concerned about the commercial real estate. On the other elements, remember, we are trying to slow down demand. We are trying to slow down the economy. That&#x27;s going to have an effect on delinquencies. It&#x27;s going to have an effect on earnings calls. These are not things… these are things we need to get the economy to slow down and also get inflation down. What we don&#x27;t want is it to go so bad that the economy goes tanking into a recession. But these are all signs of showing we&#x27;re getting the moderation in demand that we want to help us get the economy back on stable footing in terms of inflation without tossing us into a recession.</p>
    <p>Interviewer: It sounds to me like of the three scenarios I outlined, you&#x27;re less concerned about the economy, you&#x27;re less concerned about the economy re-accelerating than about either a soft landing or a recession?</p>
    <p>Waller: I mean, I wasn&#x27;t in the third quarter. I was stunned by this third quarter number. I think everybody was. It wasn&#x27;t like, where is this coming from? We are at 2%, 2%, 2%, 2%, 2%, and then almost 5%. But now, what I said is all the forecasts I&#x27;m seeing. seeing all the preliminary data that&#x27;s coming in, it&#x27;s going to be probably 1-2% in the fourth quarter, depending on which one you&#x27;re looking at. So that clearly isn&#x27;t moderation. The things you mentioned, these are all things that are telling you, look, this 5% growth isn&#x27;t going to continue for a couple of quarters. So something happened in the third quarter, I don&#x27;t know, lots of Taylor Swift concerts, I don&#x27;t know what it was something blew up the third quarter and it&#x27;s not likely to continue going forward. So that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m less, once I saw the last couple of weeks of data, I felt more confident that this seemed to be a one-off, and as I stressed, inventory investment was a big factor, and that&#x27;s, that can be some of it, it&#x27;s just pulling forward investment from the fourth quarter will be even lower. So that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m thinking that, you know, whatever we get for third quarter, it was a bit of an anomaly, It&#x27;s not going to continue.</p>
    <p>Interviewer: How much of the moderation in the fourth quarter would you attribute to Bruce Springsteen having to pull off the tour due to that peptic ulcer? It seems to me that an elephant in the room for the Fed is the fiscal situation, and of course, fiscal and monetary policy are independent, but the fiscal situation affects monetary policy, I think, in a couple of important ways. High deficits boost aggregate demand at a time when the Fed is trying to cool aggregate demand, as you say. That in turn boosts the neutral rate of interest, which means that the policy rate needs to be higher for contractionary effects. In addition, high deficits require that the Treasury sell large amounts of longer-term debt. That boosts yields, could boost the term premium. The Fed, I think, can&#x27;t just recognize that higher rates are going up because these two different effects have different implications. A higher neutral rate implies a higher policy rate. A higher term premium implies a lower policy rate. How do you think about that? How do you think about the fiscal situation as it affects the FOMC? How do you think about those competing effects of extremely large structural deficits?</p>
    <p>Waller: Yeah, so I mean the way we&#x27;ve always kind of thought about fiscal policy and monetary policy is look there&#x27;s lots of exogenous external factors that are not under our control we just take them for as given and we do the best we can in response the same is true with the exchange rate foreign government monetary policies, all sorts of trade rules that get put in it, we just, our job is to take that as given and do the best job that we can. We can&#x27;t change those things because they&#x27;re not under our control. So with fiscal policy, you know, that&#x27;s Congress&#x27;s job to do whatever they think they need to do in the administration. My job is to say, &quot;Okay, whatever it is, that&#x27;s how I have to respond.&quot; Sometimes it might make my job harder, sometimes it might make my job easier. But that&#x27;s just the way that monetary policy works. You know, on the fiscal side, it&#x27;s just, you know, we typically don&#x27;t comment, but just as a former academic economist, you know, running budget deficits of 7%, 6% of GDP in peacetime at full employment, it just doesn&#x27;t sound sustainable. It doesn&#x27;t mean there&#x27;s going to be a financial crisis around the corner, but longer term, something probably has to be done to address it.</p>
    <p>Interviewer: What is your outlook for the longer-term neutral rate?</p>
    <p>Waller: I have a whole speech on this at some point. There&#x27;s so much chatter about the long run neutral rate, and my just general comment is if you look at the real return on safe liquid government debt That thing has been falling for 40 years Just go plot it out. It just is just a long long long downward trend. The rate of return to capital due to some work by one of my colleagues in Saint Louis Ravi Kumar If you look at the average real return to capital over the last 40 years, it&#x27;s constant. It&#x27;s very volatile, but there&#x27;s no secular downward trend. So there&#x27;s something unique about safe liquid government debt, treasuries in particular, that is driving this long-term decline. So whenever people tell me it&#x27;s going to bounce back up, I always kind of ask. It&#x27;s been declining for 40 years, what is it that you suddenly think is now driving it up? I mean, just a couple of weeks ago, we heard it&#x27;s all the real rate, all the 10 year treasuries going up because R* is higher. Well, now it&#x27;s falling back six tenths. Is R* coming back down in three weeks? I mean, these just sound like, they&#x27;re just really not plausible stories. lot more work in thinking about and estimating and understanding the causes of why it would suddenly start going back up.</p>
    <p>Interviewer: Last question from me, and I know you want to stay focused on the economic outlook, but I want to ask you about the Basel endgame capital requirement proposal and your vote on that and kind of how you&#x27;re thinking about how you might further engage with that.</p>
    <p>Waller: Yeah, I mean the Basel endgame is out for comment. We had an open board meeting. We all made our official statements. I voted against it. I thought it was excessive in terms of what it was doing, particularly on one element, which was this operational risk bucket, which is mainly due to like lawsuits, cyber fraud. Those are things that don&#x27;t typically occur at the same time as an financial meltdown due to a macroeconomic shock. So they&#x27;re not correlated with market risk, trading risk, all the other things that might bring a bank down. So I would just argue that because it&#x27;s not really a threat to this, you don&#x27;t need a separate bucket for this. You can use operational risk paid for out of your standard capital bucket. So that was my argument, and I think when I look at the numbers, operational risk is something like over 50 percent of the increase in capital. So if there&#x27;s some willingness to move on operational risk and some other things, there is a possibility that this could be put forward in a revamped way that would be acceptable.</p>
    <p>Interviewer: Okay. Let&#x27;s take questions. Yes, sir.</p>
    <p>Question: Okay. Hi, Nick Timoros of the Wall Street Journal. Governor Waller, I want to ask you about something you said at the beginning of the year. The beginning of the year, there was a disconnect between what you and your colleagues were saying about the path of policy for this year and what the markets were pricing, and the markets were pricing in a lower policy rate by the end of this year, and you had said you&#x27;d kind of characterized this as a miraculous melting away of inflation, that the market expected that you didn&#x27;t see. Since June, we&#x27;ve now seen, with this week&#x27;s reading, perhaps five months of better behaved core PCE inflation could be annualized around 2.5%, and so I&#x27;m wondering if that continues, if that would count in your book as this miraculous melting away of inflation. I guess the question I&#x27;m building up to is, at what point would you say maybe policy rates could be lowered, that a 5 and 3/8 policy rate wouldn&#x27;t be appropriate if inflation could be sustained at 2.5% core inflation? Thank you.</p>
    <p>Waller: Yeah. So back in January, yeah, as Nick pointed out, there&#x27;s been a couple of disconnects. between us and the markets over the last 18 months. In January, I was saying this was just due to forecast. We just had different forecasts. It wasn&#x27;t like somebody was right and wrong. We just had different forecasts of what was going to happen. The market, I argued, as Nick said, I viewed the market was thinking inflation was going to be at 2.5% by the summer. I didn&#x27;t think it was going to go down that far. Where we&#x27;re looking at being for the 12 months at the end of the year is about what I thought it would be back in January, somewhere between 3% to 3.5%. That&#x27;s what I had in mind back in early January. So it&#x27;s kind of played out that way. It&#x27;s been bumpy. There have been months where it was much better and looked like it was going to be a miraculous disinflation, and then it popped back up like in September. I think it&#x27;s heading the inflation rates moving along pretty much like I thought. If you think about in central banking, we talk about a Taylor rule or various types of Taylor rules to give us a rule of thumb about how we think we should set policy, and every one of those things would say, if inflation&#x27;s coming down, you don&#x27;t need to keep… once you get rates or inflation down low enough, you don&#x27;t necessarily have to keep rates up at those levels. There&#x27;s certainly good economic arguments from any kind of standard tailor that would tell you if inflation… if we see this inflation continuing for several more months… I don&#x27;t know how long that might be, three months, four months, five months, that we feel confident that inflation is really down and on its way, that you could then start lowering the policy rate just because inflation&#x27;s lower. It has nothing to do with trying to save the economy or recession. It&#x27;s just consistent with every policy rule I know from my academic life and as a policy maker. If inflation goes down, you would lower you would lower the policy rate. So yeah, there&#x27;s just no reason to say you would keep it really high and inflation&#x27;s back a target, for example.</p>
    <p>Interviewer: Other questions?</p>
    <p>Question: My question was about inflation and how it affects the economy like how would you categorize inflation as being attributed to supply shocks in this in the wake of the pandemic and then because the supply rebounded you see inflation coming back down versus the sudden jump in the money supply when the pandemic first hit? Thank you.</p>
    <p>Waller: Yeah, so I mean this is a standard question people always try to sort of how much of this was supply and how much of it was demand, and my view is both. The thing that always leads me to think about it being a lot of demand is that if it was really all supply, prices went up, but when the thing reverses, all the prices should have come down. You have deflation. We didn&#x27;t get deflation. We just got a slowing of inflation. We got disinflation. So that tells you something happened that permanently raised the price level and that&#x27;s typically something on the demand side so that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m not a big believer that says is all supply side stuff because we should have had deflation as all the supply stuff unwound, so it had to be a very strong demand element to it. You know, there&#x27;s a funny problem sorting out supply and demand shocks. I kind of use this following example. If 50 of us go to a little restaurant that only has 15 seats and they run out of food, is that a supply problem or is that a demand problem? The fact that 50 people showed up is the demand side of it. The fact they ran out of food is a supply problem. thing but what caused them to run out of food. It wasn&#x27;t they forgot how to order or forgot how to cook. They just had so much demand they couldn&#x27;t keep up. I think that was a large part of what we saw in the supply side. It was just a lot of demand driven changes, particularly goods, in the early part of 2020. There&#x27;s a huge shift of goods. They weren&#x27;t ready for it and then this creates all kind of supply problems. Problems in terms of providing those goods, but it was initiated by goods demand, not necessarily some shock to the supply side of the economy.</p>
    <p>Interviewer: Let me build on your answer to that question to ask another. Before the pandemic, we were worried about low real interest rates. We were worried about below target inflation. How can we get inflation back to target? We were worried about the possibility of declining inflation expectations and as you say over the decades prior to the pandemic we just saw real rates go down and down. This is driven in the view of many economists by slow-moving structural factors, demographics, the supply and demand of enforced savings, technological change that affects the way people enter the workforce, and we had this pandemic, and we had extraordinary fiscal and monetary support. We had substantial supply chain challenges, and now we&#x27;re kind of unwinding all of that. Big debate. Does the world after this business cycle look like it did in 2017? 2017, 2018, 2019, or are we in a world of permanently higher interest rates? Are we in a world where the challenge is not to get inflation up to 2%? It&#x27;s to get inflation down to 2%. It seems to me that if you believe that the 2017, 2018, and 2019 world was created by these sorts of slow-moving structural factors, you would conclude that the world after this business cycle will look an awful lot like it did before the pandemic. Is that your view? If not, where are we differing?</p>
    <p>Waller: Again, this is back to what I was saying about the whole R*. When people say declining low real rates, they&#x27;re talking about real rates on government debt. You go, I&#x27;m telling you, go look at the work my colleague Ravi Kumar at St. Louis Fed did and other academics that have done it since then. The real return to capital has no secular downward trend. It&#x27;s bouncing around, but it&#x27;s roughly 7% in real terms. So, technology, productivity growth, these are all things that should be affecting that as well as it. The fact that real returns on government debt have fallen for 40 years and the average return to capital hasn&#x27;t changed says there&#x27;s something special, about U.S. Treasuries, and that you can&#x27;t mix that up. There are explanations, there&#x27;s potential explanations. But you can&#x27;t mix that up with things that should be driving also the real return to capital. Because if those things were lowering it, that thing should be coming down too, and there&#x27;s just no evidence of it. So there&#x27;s something unique about government debt, and you want to sort these two things out. What would be things that would not affect the real return to capital, but would affect the real return on safe, liquid government debt. U.S. Treasuries are special objects. They&#x27;re very special financial instruments compared to a lot of things on the planet. So just looking at that and making broad statements about the economy can kind of lead you off in the wrong direction.</p>
    <p>Question: Said the word demographics and that made me wonder the working age population has sort of flatlined in the last five years the birth rate and the number of babies born has been falling since the Great Recession how. How does it look 10, 20 years from now when the the worker to retiree ratio is going crazy and there&#x27;s not the steady increase in working age population that we&#x27;ve had for the rest of American history.</p>
    <p>Waller: Yeah, I mean, the thing about demographics is they&#x27;re very slow moving. They&#x27;re generally, right, these are really slow moving. They&#x27;re very predictable in terms of what can happen. So for example, the declining labor force participation started back in roughly 2000. out 20 years, and it&#x27;s amazing how accurate those predictions are right now. It&#x27;s just amazing. This really surprising thing you mentioned, which I have my own just general concerns as an economist, not as a policymaker, but the huge drop in fertility rates in the U.S. in the last 10 years is really stunning. a replacement ratio of about two, fertility rate of two, to like 1.2. This starts looking like Italy, Eastern Europe. This has got very long-term consequences, now whether it rebounds or not, or it&#x27;s just a hangover from whatever else. That fertility rate, which hasn&#x27;t been talked about a whole lot, is going to have some really implications. 20 years from now, if instead of two children, every woman&#x27;s having one. Think about just colleges. How many colleges do you need? Sorry, no offense to my academic colleagues, but it&#x27;s these kind of implications that, and that&#x27;s, that&#x27;s, you know, if you&#x27;re 10 years into this, you&#x27;re talking just 10 years from now, you&#x27;re going to see a huge drop, and the number of kids graduating from high school, going to college, labor force. So I think this fertility rate decline is a major issue that hasn&#x27;t really gotten a lot of focus, and like I said, you said it started roughly after the great financial crisis. You&#x27;re 10 plus years into this already. It&#x27;s going to start showing up in the next decade.</p>
    <p>Interviewer: Okay, well, I promised you we&#x27;d be out of here at 10:45 and it&#x27;s 10:47. So thank you so much, Governor Waller. Thank you.</p>
